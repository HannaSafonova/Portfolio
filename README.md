## [Project1. Database design writing in SQL.](https://github.com/HannaSafonova/Portfolio/blob/main/SQL/SQL%20Design.sql)
1. Designing a database for course management.
   The database contains the following entities:
 a. students: student_no, teacher_no, course_no, student_name, email, birth_date.
 b. teachers: teacher_no, teacher_name, phone_no.
 c. courses: course_no, course_name, start_date, end_date.
- Partitioning the students table by years using the range mechanism on the birth_date field.
- In the students table, establishing a composite primary key consisting of student_no and birth_date.
- Creating an index on the students.email field.
- Establishing a unique index on the teachers.phone_no field.
2. Adding test data.
3. Writing a query that outputs rows with duplicates.
